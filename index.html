    <h2>Någon text</h2>
    <p class="fettext">Personligen så tycker jag att du har fel och för denna anledning så ska du danca och läsa 10 andrew tate quotes, 
      
    </p>“The masculine perspective is you have to understand that life is war. It’s a war for the female you want. It’s a war for the car you want. It’s a war for the money you want. It’s a war for the status. Masculine life is war.

If you’re a man who doesn’t view life as war, you’re going to lose. Society’s expectations of men is much higher than the societal expectations of females.”


    </p>“The hallmark of a real man is controlling himself, controlling his emotions, and acting appropriately regardless of how he feels.”

    </p>“Men who live without self control are the kind of men who cry when their girlfriend cheats on them, ‘cus she certainly does, because she doesn’t respect a little cry baby, and she’s only with you because she’s ugly as f*ck and she has to settle for a little soy boy p*ssy like you.”</p>

    </P>“If you could choose to build yourself from the ground up… Like from a video game, just tick characteristic boxes and build yourself, nobody would choose to be a liberal soy boy. Nobody would choose to be a small weak guy who has to cry when he gets upset.”.<p>
